# BC

Simple programming language and calculator

## Build

```sh
make
```

## TODO

- Use nix
- Fix tracing
- Fix error reporting
- Use Vu<char*> instead of std::string, maybe even alias it
- String builder should use arenas and Vu's for sure
- Events should have type but also level
- X macros for the enums might be a good idea

- Implement
  - logical operators || && !
  - bit operators | & ~ ^
  - functions
  - structs
  - unions
  - patterns
  - if, for, when
  - compile-time functionality


- Interface functions should have top level comments
